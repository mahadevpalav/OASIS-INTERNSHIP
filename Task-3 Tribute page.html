				<b>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam,</b> (born Oct. 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian president
				 (2002–07). After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology, Kalam played a leading role in the 
				 development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He planned a program that produced 
				 a number of successful missiles, helping earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Beginning in the 
				 early 1990s, he also served as scientific adviser to the government, and his prominent role in India’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests established Kalam as a national hero. In 2002 the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) National Democratic Alliance nominated Kalam, a Muslim, to succeed outgoing President K.R. Narayanan. Kalam easily won the elections in 2002, and in the largely ceremonial post he sought to use science and technology to 
				transform India into a developed country. In 2007 he was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s 
				first woman president.

            <p>
                <b>Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam's Biography - About His Family and Struggle Life </b>
Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam was born to a poor Tamil Muslim family. He lived with his family in the temple city of 
Tamilnadu, Rameswaram, where his father, Jainulabdeen, had a boat and was an imam of a local mosque. 
At the same time, his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and one sister in his family,
from which he was the youngest. Kalam's ancestors were wealthy traders and landowners and had vast land and
property tracts. But with time, their business of ferrying pilgrims and trading groceries suffered huge losses 
due to the Pamban Bridge's opening. As a result, Kalam's family had become inadequate and struggled hard to make 
a living. At a tender age, Kalam had to sell newspapers to supplement his family income.<br>


<b>Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam's Biography - Educational Background of Kalam</b>
Although Kalam had average grades in school, he was very hard working and had an immense desire to learn. 
He spent a lot of time studying and had developed a particular interest in mathematics. Kalam left Schwartz 
higher secondary school after completing his early education and went to Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli. 
From Saint Joseph's College, he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace 
engineering at Madras Institute of Technology.<br>


<b>Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam's Biography - Kalam as a Scientist</b>
Kalam joined as a scientist in the aeronautical development establishment of DRDO in 1960, after graduation. 
His career started with him designing a small hovercraft. However, he was not convinced by his choice of a 
job at the DRDO. Kalam was transferred to ISRO in 1969, where he was the project director of India's first 
satellite vehicle launch. The satellite vehicle deployed the Rohini satellite successfully in near-Earth orbit 
in July 1980. Kalam received the Government's LV and Slv projects between the 1970s-90s. He directed two projects 
like Project Devil and Project Valiant, which aimed at developing ballistic missiles from the successful 
SLV program's technology Kalam somehow convinced Indira Gandhi and sought secret funds for these aerospace 
projects. His research and immense knowledge brought him and the nation great laurels in the 1980s.
<br>

Kalam then went on to become the scientific advisor of the defence minister in 1992 
and served at the same post for five years before getting promoted to the post of principal scientific 
advisor to the government. His immense role in the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a 
nuclear power. Kamal had now become a national hero, to be remembered for ages to come. However, the tests he 
conducted caused a huge uproar in the international community. Kamal put forward a nationwide plan called 
Technology Vision 2020, which according to him, was a fantastic way for transforming the stature of India 
in 20 years, taking it from a developing to a developed nation. The plan envisioned the progress of the 
nation by adopting advanced technology, expanding healthcare facilities, and emphasizing the education 
of the masses.

<b>Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam's Biography -Kalam as the 11th President of India</b> <br>
Sir Kalam was entitled to be the 11th president of India. His term period of 25th July 2002 to 25th July 2007

who has a professional set up under the royal family, who has some kind of provision with or who is taking a 
pension from the prince has the right to work for the of the “House of Commons”. This will allow the royal 
family to have zero influence on the administrative conditions.<br>


He had also become one of the most talked-about presidents Rule in 2005 for imposing the Presidents’ 
rule in Bihar. Kalam expressed his wish to take up the position one more time but then later changed his mind.


After taking farewell from the office, he shifted and commenced his career as a visiting professor at 
the Indian Institute of Management in Shillong. He served as an Aerospace Engineering professor at Anna 
University, Tamil Nadu. He also lit up educational institutions like the Indian Institute of Indore, 
Indian Institute of Bangalore with his presence and knowledge. Sir Kalam served as chancellor Indian 
Institute of Space Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram.<br>

from the country.
